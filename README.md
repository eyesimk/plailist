This project is an AI‑powered playlist builder that understands your mood and generates playlists based on your input. Users can add the generated playlist to their Spotify library with a single click. 

Due to recent Spotify Web API restrictions, audio_features are no longer accessible.
This project uses a dataset that contains some audio features fetched from an earlier version of the Spotify API, before these limitations were enforced.
